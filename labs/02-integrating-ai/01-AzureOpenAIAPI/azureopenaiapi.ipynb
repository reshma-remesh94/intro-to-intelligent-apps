With the Genie's help, Aladdin embarked on a quest to win the heart of Princess Jasmine, who was confined within the palace walls by her father, the Sultan. Along the way, Aladdin encountered the villainous Jafar, who sought to use the Genie's power for his own nefarious purposes. With daring, bravery, and a little bit of magic, Aladdin and his friends ultimately triumphed over Jafar and won the freedom of the Genie.
